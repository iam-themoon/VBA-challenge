    'I need to loop through the stock listings and output:
        '1) The ticker symbol
        '2) The yearly change from opening price at 01/01/xx to closing price at 12/31/xx
        '3) The percent change from opening price at 01/01/xx to closing price at 12/31/xx
        '4) The total stock volume
            
            
    '1) To collect the ticker symbol, I need to loop through all the rows and collect the value in column A once, into a variable.
        'After collection, the symbol/variable value needs to be printed to the worksheet, starting in cell I2
        'Then continue going through column A until the symbol changes and then repeat the process
                
    '2) To find the yearly change, I need to first find the 01/01/xx date for the first ticker symbol.
        'Once I find January 1st, I collect the opening price at that date
        'Then I need to find the 12/31/xx date and collect the closing price at that date.
        'I will put each respective value into variables, and then calculate the yearly change with them
            'The yearly change is the closing price less the opening price
            'Once calculated, this value needs to be printed to the worksheet, starting in cell J2
            
    '3) To find the percent change, I simply need to create a variable that equals the yearly change divided by the opening price
        'After calculating this, the value needs to be printed to the worksheet, starting in cell K2
        
    '4) To find the total stock volume, I need to sum all the values in column G per each ticker symbol
        'This value needs to be printed to the worksheet, starting in cell L2
