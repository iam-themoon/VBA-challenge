This code will run through each sheet of the workbook of stock information and do the following:
  1) Collect each ticker symbol once
  2) The yearly change in stock price per stock
      a) This is the closing price on the last day of the year less the opening price on the first day of the year
  3) The percent change over the year
      a) This is the yearly change divided by the opening price from the first day
  4) The total stock volume per stock per year
  
  It will also collect (per year)
  5) The stock with the greatest percent increase
  6) The stock with the greatest percent decrease

There will be a button on the first sheet that will run the code and a button to reset those columns.
